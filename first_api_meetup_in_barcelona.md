# First API Meetup in Barcelona

At 3scale, we are API nerds, and we are surely not the only one if you look at the number of API-related events around the world. During the year we participate to a lot of conferences and meetups with the API community, but nothing really existed in our local community of Barcelona beside the yearly [APIdays Mediterannea](http://mediterranea.apidays.io).

We wanted to host a local group for local hackers to exchange about APIs and show to the world that Barcelona has an active tech scene. This meetup would let local hackers present their work on APIs, as well as giving them the opportunity to listen to world-class international speakers. We plan to host this meetup regularly, approximately every 3 months in our 3scale office, Spain.

What better date than the week of Mobile World Congress to do the first meetup?

For our first edition we had the pleasure to host the Twitter Advocates team as part of their international tour of Twitter Flock. Just arriving from Berlin, [Romain](http://twitter.com/romainhuet) and [Gareth](https://twitter.com/gpj) made an awesome presentation about the [Fabric](http://fabric.io) SDK.

Mobile developers in the audience got excited by this stack. They could use [Crashlytics](https://get.fabric.io/crashlytics) to get crash reports from their apps, [Beta](https://get.fabric.io/beta) to distribute their app to beta users, or [Digits](https://get.fabric.io/digits) to authenticate users with phone numbers, and [Mopub](https://get.fabric.io/mopub) to generate revenues with ads. Twitter Evangelists also showcased how easy it is to display tweets natively into your app. Way more easier that all the custom integrations we tried before.

I personnaly got very excited by Digits part, as it simplifies user onboarding. Phone number is used as username. Easier to remember than a email/password. Also, it's available as a Javascript SDK, so you can have Digits everywhere.

After this great presentation of the new Twitter SDK, we took a small break to feed the geeks, and we jumped right on into the next presentation.

I wanted to present to mobile Developers how they could use [APItools](http://apitools.com) to enhance their mobile development experience. Over the last year, we've seen great usage of [APItools](http://apitools.com) in the mobile community. Tools like Xcode or Android Studio don't really give good feedback to developers when it comes to calling HTTP APIs. When you use [APItools](http://apitools.com) proxy, you have full access to the requests made by your App and the response coming back from the API. It's really useful to understand for debugging purposes.

I also showed how [APItools](http://apitools.com) could be used to reduce the payload of a request and do computation on the fly. In the example we were calling Leafly API to find local "coffee shops" in combination with Google Maps API to get the walking distance to those stores. You could fine the source of the project [here](https://github.com/picsoung/localhemp) and the slides [here](https://speakerdeck.com/apitools/enhance-mobile-dev-with-apitools)

In the end we had over 80 people at 3scale office for this first time. It was great success!

We would not be able to host this meetup without the support of our lovely sponsors: [Twitter](http://twitter.com/TwitterDev), [Context.io](http://context.io) and [CloudElements](http://cloudelements.com). Show them some love.

Our next meetup for [#APImeetupBCN](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23APImeetupbcn&src=typd) is already in the planning. Subscribe to our meetup group to stay up to date. And feel free to reach out to use if you want to sponsor it or want to talk at the meetup.
