# 3scale at RailsGirls Barcelona

Last weekend (28 & 29 of March) 3scale participated both as a sponsor and provider of coaches for [RailsGirls Barcelona](http://railsgirls.com/barcelona) workshop. 

[RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com) is a community that organizes Ruby on Rails workshop all around the world. Its goal is to help participants (who can be as well men) with begin learning how to code.

Our Solution Engineer - [Pili](https://twitter.com/mpguerra) was one of the organisers, our Hacker in House [Nico](https://twitter.com/picsoung) and [myself](https://twitter.com/jam_aga) (a fresh member of the Engineering team) were coaches and Ania (HR Coordinator) together with [Etienne](https://twitter.com/Etienne_3s) (Sales team) were students.

I am very happy of the outcome of this weekend, because in 2013 I was a student in the first [RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com) held in Barcelona. That's where I got interested in coding & web development. At that time I was working in 3scale's marketing & sales department.

Then for a long time I did not continue to learn coding till one day I started again and got interested in it so much that I did an 8 week web development bootcamp and got opportunity to join 3scaleÂ´s engineering team.
This is for me a great experience and opportuniy to continue my adventure with programming. I am very proud that I had chance to give back to [RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com) together with my awesome colleagues. The whole event was great!

Here are some testimonies of my fellow colleagues new to programming

Ania: *Taking part in Rails Girls was challenging, incredibly beneficial, great experience. I had an opportunity to actually see what programming is and understand better how tech world works. Obviously It would not be possible without great people (both organizers and mentors) I had a chance to meet, who made this event so special. I will definitely attend next event organized by this crew!*

Etienne: *Having worked over the past 4 months in 3scale, a young and very dynamic company in Barcelona, I started to wonder what the coders on the 7th floor could be doing. Overly curious I decided to get a dive and I followed the Python tutorial on CodeAcademy. Unfortunately this didn't satisfy my thirst for knowledge and when I heard about RailsGirls I decided to go and buy a wig (luckily nobody asked me to wear it) in order to attend the event. This was a great experience. On the one hand because of the speakers: mostly persons that had a non-tech academic background and that gave us the feeling that the journey they began was something worth trying. Secondly because of the coaches and the resources available to discover Ruby on Rails. The tutorial TryRuby, seemed a bit like a joke but the resources available to develop the web app 'Ideas' were just awesome. With the help of my coach I get as far as deploying my app online and adding to it a few features. The best is that I left with the feeling that I understood what I did and the desire to try to build something more difficult. Thank you RailsGirls for this awesome experience! (and the great food)!*
